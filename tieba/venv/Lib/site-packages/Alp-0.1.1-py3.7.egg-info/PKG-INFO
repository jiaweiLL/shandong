        Alp software
        ============
        
        The Alp is a new unit meant for measuring time. To understand and use
        this unit, the program included in this distribution has been
        created. It's both a command-line tool, named "alp", and a Python
        module.
        
        You can learn about the Alp unit and download documentation about it
        at http://metanohi.org/projects/alp/
        
        
        License
        =======
        
        Alp software is free software under the terms of the GNU General
        Public License version 3 (or any later version). The author of Alp
        software is Niels Serup, contactable at ns@metanohi.org. This is
        version 0.1.1 of the program.
        
        The libraries used by Alp software are GPL-compatible.
        
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        The Alp program and module is contained in a single file,
        ``alp.py``. It is not necessary to install it, but it can make it
        easier to use the Alp software.
        
        Way #1
        ------
        Just run this (requires that you have python-setuptools installed)::
        
          # easy_install Alp
        
        Way #2
        ------
        Get the newest version of Alp at
        http://metanohi.org/projects/alp/ or at
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Alp
        
        Extract the downloaded file and run this in a terminal::
        
          # python setup.py install
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        Python 2.5+ is probably a requirement.
        
        For formatting and control codes, Alp will attempt to use ncurses. If
        that fails, Alp will try to use the Python termcolor module, available
        at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/termcolor/, installable using ``$ sudo
        easy_install termcolor`` (released under the GPLv3+).
        
        If present, Alp will also use the ``setproctitle`` Python module,
        available at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setproctitle/, installable
        using ``$ sudo easy_install setproctitle`` (released under the New BSD
        License).
        
        
        Using
        =====
        
        When using the Alp software as a command-line tool, simply run
        ``alp``. Run ``alp --help`` to see what options you can specify.
        
        When using it as a module, just use ``import alp`` in your Python
        program. To learn how the Alp module works, run ``pydoc alp`` or
        ``python -c 'import alp; help(alp)'``. There are also a couple of
        tests in the ``tests`` directory.
        
        
        Developing
        ==========
        
        Alp software is written in Python and uses Git for branches. To get the
        latest branch, get it from gitorious.org like this::
        
          $ git clone git://gitorious.org/Alp/alp.git
